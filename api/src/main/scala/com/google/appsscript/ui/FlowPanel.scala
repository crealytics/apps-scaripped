/**
 * FlowPanel Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A panel that formats its child widgets using the default HTML layout behavior. Here is an example of how to use this widget: 
 *  
 * 
 *  function doGet() {
 *    var app = UiApp.createApplication();
 *    var panel = app.createFlowPanel();
 *    panel.add(app.createButton("button 1"));
 *    panel.add(app.createButton("button 2"));
 *    app.add(panel);
 *    return app;
 *  }
 *  
 *  Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the FlowPanel documentation here.
