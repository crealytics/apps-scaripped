/** DecoratedTabBar Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A TabBar that wraps each tab in a 2x3 grid (six box), which allows users to add rounded corners. Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the DecoratedTabBar documentation here. */
