/**
 * FormPanel Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A panel that wraps its contents in an HTML <FORM> element. This panel can be used with a SubmitButton to post form values to the server. All children of this panel (direct, or even children of sub-panels) that have a setName function and have been given a name will have their values sent to the server when the form is submitted. The submit can be handled in the special "doPost" function, as shown in the example. Note that this panel can contain at most one direct child widget. To add more children, make the child of this panel a different panel that can contain more than one child. Here is an example of how to use this widget: 
 *  
 * 
 *  function doGet() {
 *    var app = UiApp.createApplication();
 *    var form = app.createFormPanel();
 *    var flow = app.createFlowPanel();
 *    flow.add(app.createTextBox().setName("textBox"));
 *    flow.add(app.createListBox().setName("listBox").addItem("option 1").addItem("option 2"));
 *    flow.add(app.createSubmitButton("Submit"));
 *    form.add(flow);
 *    app.add(form);
 *    return app;
 *  }
 * 
 *  function doPost(eventInfo) {
 *    var app = UiApp.getActiveApplication();
 *    app.add(app.createLabel("Form submitted. The text box's value was '" +
 *        eventInfo.parameter.textBox +
 *        "' and the list box's value was '" +
 *        eventInfo.parameter.listBox + "'"));
 *    return app;
 *  }
 *  
 *  Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the FormPanel documentation here.
