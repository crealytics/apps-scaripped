/**
 * DatePicker Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A date picker widget. Here is an example of how to use this widget: 
 *  
 * 
 *  function doGet() {
 *    var app = UiApp.createApplication();
 *    var handler = app.createServerHandler("change");
 *    var picker = app.createDatePicker().addValueChangeHandler(handler).setId("picker");
 *    app.add(picker);
 *    return app;
 *  }
 * 
 *  function change(eventInfo) {
 *    var app = UiApp.getActiveApplication();
 *    app.add(app.createLabel("The value of the date picker changed to " +
 *        eventInfo.parameter.picker));
 *     return app;
 *   }
 *  
 *  Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the DatePicker documentation here.
