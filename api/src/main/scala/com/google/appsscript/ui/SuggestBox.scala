A SuggestBox is a text box or text area which displays a pre-configured set of selections that match the user's input. This widget is not currently functional. Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the SuggestBox documentation here. */
