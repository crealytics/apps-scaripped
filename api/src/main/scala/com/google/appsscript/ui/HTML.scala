/**
 * HTML Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A widget that contains arbitrary text, which is interpreted as HTML. Only basic HTML markup such as bold, italic, etc. are allowed; in particular, scripts will be stripped out completely. Here is an example of how to use this widget:
 *
 *
 *  function doGet() {
 *    var app = UiApp.createApplication();
 *    app.add(app.createHTML("<b>Hello World!</b>"));
 *    return app;
 *  }
 *
 *  Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the HTML documentation here.
