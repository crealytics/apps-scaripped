/** ToggleButton Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A ToggleButton is a stylish stateful button which allows the user to toggle between up and down states. Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the ToggleButton documentation here. */
