/**
 * ResetButton Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A standard push-button widget which will automatically reset its enclosing FormPanel if any. Here is an example of how to use this widget: 
 *  
 * 
 *  function doGet() {
 *    var app = UiApp.createApplication();
 *    var panel = app.createFlowPanel();
 *    panel.add(app.createTextBox().setText("some text"));
 *    panel.add(app.createResetButton("reset the textbox"));
 *    var form = app.createFormPanel();
 *    form.add(panel);
 *    app.add(form);
 *    return app;
 *  }
 *  
 *  Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the ResetButton documentation here.
