/** SplitLayoutPanel Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A panel that adds user-positioned splitters between each of its child widgets. This panel is similar to a DockLayoutPanel, but each pair of child widgets has a splitter between them that the user can drag. Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the SplitLayoutPanel documentation here. */
