/** StackPanel Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A panel that stacks its children vertically, displaying only one at a time, with a header for each child which the user can click to display. Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the StackPanel documentation here. */
