A menu bar can contain any number of menu items, each of which can either fire an event handler or open a cascaded menu bar. Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the MenuBar documentation here. */
