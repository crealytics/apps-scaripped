/** SimpleRadioButton Deprecated. The UI service was deprecated on December 11, 2014. To create user interfaces, use the HTML service instead. A simple radio button widget, with no label. SimpleRadioButtons are grouped according to the same rules as RadioButtons. Internally, UiApp widgets are built on top of the Google Web Toolkit, and it can sometimes be helpful to look at the GWT documentation directly. You can find the SimpleRadioButton documentation here. */
